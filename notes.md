# Notes
# PAL Basics
* 25 fps, with 50 fields being interlaced
* Phase of each feild alternates by $180\degree$
    * technically each line alternates in each phase, but because of interlacing this means each feild alternates in phase
* A PAL signal contains 2 minor signals: the chrominance and luminance
    * the luminance is the B/W i.e. the image
    * the chrominance is the colour
* The chrominance consits of two other signals that are modulated onto a 4.43MHz subcarier - the colour burst.
    * these two signals are the B-Y and R-Y signals.
